      <title>[Paperleap podcast] OLEDs may be the key to holography</title>
      <description>Researchers at the University of St Andrews have demonstrated that pairing OLEDs with metasurfaces and filters can project holographic images without the need for lasers. This compact, safe, and scalable approach could pave the way for everyday holographic displays in consumer devices.

      <title>[Breakthrough Broadcast] Floating on Sound: The Physics Behind Acoustic Levitation</title>
      <description>I’m Drew, and in this episode of Breakthrough Broadcast, we’re exploring a technology that looks like science fiction but is entirely real: acoustic levitation. Imagine droplets of water, tiny beads, or bits of plastic hovering in midair—no strings, no magnets, just sound. Using carefully arranged sound waves, scientists can suspend objects, move them, and even merge them together while they float.
We’ll break down how it works, from the physics of standing waves to the invisible “nodes” that ho</description>

Just getting our stuff into orbit isn’t enough… Orbital Operations wants to help companies take things HIGHER.
In today’s TWiST 500 interview, Alex chats with Ben Schleuniger, whose startup Orbital Operations is solving the complexity of space logistics. The advent of reusable rockets has made it easier and cheaper than ever for us to place objects in Low Earth Orbit (or LEO).
But what if we want to reach higher orbits?</description>

      <description>Interior designers often find themselves defending beautiful, well-considered ideas to hesitant clients. But what if that hesitation isn’t resistance—it’s biology? In this episode, Kimberley Seldon speaks with designer and BOD™ Member, Martha Lowry about neuro-aesthetics and how the brain responds to space long before logic or language catch up.

This conversation reframes how designers understand client reactions, decision-making, and emotional buy-in. You’ll learn why a room can be technically</description>

      <description>Somewhere, in a Trump administration office, someone decided that architects aren’t all that and now they’re being de-professionalised and removed from public debate. At the same time, more and more research is telling us that architecture happens inside your head and we need to design that way. 
But what does this have to do with World War 2 battleships and the state of education? Radha thinks that the banning of architects from public discourse gives us an opportunity to reimagine what ways, f</description>
